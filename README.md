# pws-tools
General powershell tools that can be used to create modules or automate tasks without having to write a new script each time.

Planning on making more general ones, but these are the ones that have been requested via work or other issues I've had. 

There is no guarantee anything here is working, I just kinda tinker and push to master when I feel like it.
